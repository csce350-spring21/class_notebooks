    "## Purpose:\n",
    "1. To demonstrate different strategies for a relatively simple problem\n",
    "    - Not all strategies \"yield\" improvement over the Brute Force approach, and probably make them less efficient due to extra complexity (recursive calls, extra space, etc.)\n",
    "    - But an algorithm design strategy, even if ineffective, allows you to look at the problem differently and may reveal a better approach\n",
    "1. To get you used to basic Python Syntax, as most of you have not spent much or any time with it. This will be quite useful for me to generate additional examples where I don't think a C++ version is particularly helpful. Python is:\n",
    "    - \\+ Readable, typically easy to read for those with an imperative language background (C,C++,Java)\n",
    "    - \\+ Writable, easy to write\n",

    "        - \\- white space sensitive: tends to be rough when coming from C-style languages (C, C++, Java) at first\n",
    "        - \\+ good, extensive libraries for many varied tasks\n",
    "            - used for deep learning libraries, data visualization (often in Jupyter notebooks), etc.\n",
    "            - also a very helpful tool for programming tasks, like manipulating folders, etc.\n",
    "    - \\+ has useful data structures *without including libraries* such as lists (__[like Java ArrayList, C++ vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_array)__), which are really interesting data structures in their own right and will likely be covered at some point, and **dict**ionaries (hash tables)\n",
    "1. To get you used to basic Jupyter notebook usage. This is a great way for me to share code/examples with you. __[(command cheat sheet)](https://www.edureka.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Jupyter_Notebook_CheatSheet_Edureka.pdf)__\n",
